As high school students prepare to apply to colleges, they want to consider their college experience.  What type of college town are their target schools based in? They can't afford to visit all.  Therefore, we will leverage the Foursquare API and develop a K-means clustering to get some sense of what types of environments exist and how similar different schools are.  ",
